📤 Output of the Code
After executing the program, the following outputs are generated:

1️⃣ Dataset Information (Printed Output)
The program first prints basic information about the dataset:

Text
Number of samples: <n_samples>
Number of features: 90000
Number of classes: <n_classes>
Explanation:
Number of samples: Total number of face images loaded from all folders.
Number of features: Each image is resized to 300 × 300, resulting in 300 × 300 = 90,000 pixel values per image.
Number of classes: Total number of unique persons (folders).

2️⃣ Eigenfaces Visualization (PCA Output)
After applying PCA with n_components = 150, the system displays a gallery of Eigenfaces.
What you see:
Grayscale face-like images
Each eigenface represents a principal component
These eigenfaces capture dominant facial features such as eyes, nose, and face contours
Meaning:
PCA converts high-dimensional images into a low-dimensional space
Eigenfaces represent the directions of maximum variance
Noise and redundant information are reduced

3️⃣ PCA Projection Shapes
Printed output:
Text
Projecting the input data on the eigenfaces orthonormal basis
(X_train_pca.shape, X_test_pca.shape)
Example:

Text
(270, 150) (180, 150)
Explanation:
Each face image is now represented by 150 PCA features
Original 90,000-dimensional data is reduced to just 150 dimensions

4️⃣ ANN (MLPClassifier) Training Output
During ANN training, the following is displayed:
Text
Iteration 1, loss = 2.52
Iteration 2, loss = 2.50
Iteration 3, loss = 2.47
...
Iteration n, loss = 0.08
Explanation:
These are training loss values
Loss gradually decreases, showing that:
The neural network is learning
Error is being minimized using back-propagation
Training stops after max_iter = 1000 or convergence

5️⃣ Face Recognition Visualization (Final Output)
After prediction, a gallery of test images is displayed.
Each image is labeled as:
Text
pred: <Predicted_Name>, pr: <Probability>
true: <Actual_Name>
Example:

pred: Alia, pr: 0.9
true: Alia
Explanation:
pred → Name predicted by the ANN
pr → Confidence probability of prediction
true → Actual person name
Correct predictions show matching pred and true

6️⃣ Accuracy Output (Final Result)
Printed at the end:

Text
Accuracy: 70.79
Meaning:
The system correctly recognized approximately 71% of the test images
Accuracy is calculated as:

   Accuracy=(Correct Prediction/Total Test Sample)*100
